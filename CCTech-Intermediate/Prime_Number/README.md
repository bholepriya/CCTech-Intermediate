************************    Test strategy  *********************
1)First find how to check the number is prime or not.
 PRIME NUMBER :- 
            The number which is divisible by 1 and itself it is called prime number.
2)First find the test cases for the prime number.
3)Write a isPrime() in that first the condition to check wheter the input is equal to zero or if one then it is not a prime number,
  and then check whether number is not negative.(negative number never be prime number).
4)Write a logic to check whether the input is prime or not.

************************    Test Cases    ***********************

1)if the input is 0 and 1 then output is false.

2)If input is negative then output is false.

3)if input is that which will be divided by only itself and 1 then it is a prime number then it is not a prime number.
